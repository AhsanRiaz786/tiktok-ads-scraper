## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with these additional guidelines:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use type hints where possible

### Code Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting:

```bash
black .
```

### Linting

Run flake8 to check for style issues:

```bash
flake8 .
```

### Type Checking

Use mypy for type checking:

```bash
mypy .
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure tests are descriptive and cover edge cases
- Mock external dependencies (TikTok API calls, file operations)
- Test files should be named `test_*.py`

### Test Coverage

Aim for at least 80% test coverage for new code:

```bash
pytest --cov=.
```
